Manifesto for the Cthulhu Assembler

This is the original document that sets out the vision for the Cthulhu
Assembler for the 65816 MPU. It is mostly included for historical reasons
and is superceded by the manual and other documents. 


GOAL

The primary goal is to write a powerful assembler for the Simpler Assembler
Nation (SAN) for the 65816 MPU for my own use. Secondary goals are learning how
to create a lexer and parser, and deeping the understanding of Go (golang). 


WHY GO?

Python would be a better choice for a project that others are going to use.
However, realistically, not many other people will be using SAN. This
creates a good chance to deeping Go knowledge. Also, Go is fast, of
low complexity, and has a strong type system. Concurrency is secondary.


HIGH LEVEL

Allows libraries for different mnemonics ("front ends") with a common 
Intermediate Representation (IR)
