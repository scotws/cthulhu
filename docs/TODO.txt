TODO NEXT

- LEXER: handle ".include" files; add filename to token information
- PARSER: Test; make sure inline comments are honored
- PARSER: add ".assert <string>" directive
- PARSER: add ".macro <string>" directive
- FORMATTER: Write; add option "format only", printing on stdout
- CONVERTER: Write; add option "convert to WDC only"
- OPTIZIMER: Add "purge" pass

COOL STUFF TRICKS

- Enable type checking for directives and instructions

- Define .ram and .rom regions and make sure there are no attempts to (say)
  write outside of ROM or read outside of RAM or ROM. Formats:

        .ram $0000 ... $7FFF
        .ram $FF00
        .ram $FF00, $FF01

- Allow asserting if MPU is in a native or emulated state (65816)

- Support "linear mode" where the whole address space can by used by
  figuring out where the blocks end and a jmp.l takes us to the next
  block (65816)

- Support "relocation" mode where everything is branches and no jumps



DO LATER

- Built-in macro for movement: 
        .move <source> <count> "to" <destination> <EOL> (65816)
        .move <addr1> ... <addr2> "to" <destination> <EOL> 

- Built-in marco for loop: 
        .loop x <start> ... <end> <EOL>
                <instructions>
        .lend
