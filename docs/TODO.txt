- Write first primitive lexer
- Write first primitive formatter
- Write first primitive parser


PARSER TRICKS

- Define .ram and .rom regions and make sure there are no attempts to (say)
  write outside of ROM or read outside of RAM or ROM. Formats:

        .ram $0000-$7FFF
        .ram $FF00
        .ram $FF00, $FF01

- Allow asserting if MPU is in a native or emulated state

- Support "linear mode" where the whole address space can by used by
  figuring out where the blocks end and a jmp.l takes us to the next
  block

- Support "relocation" mode where everything is branches and no jumps
