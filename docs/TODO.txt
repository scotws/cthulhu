TODO NEXT

- Continue work on parser

COOL STUFF TRICKS

- Enable type checking for directives and instructions

- Define .ram and .rom regions and make sure there are no attempts to (say)
  write outside of ROM or read outside of RAM or ROM. Formats:

        .ram $0000-$7FFF
        .ram $FF00
        .ram $FF00, $FF01

- Allow asserting if MPU is in a native or emulated state (65816)

- Support "linear mode" where the whole address space can by used by
  figuring out where the blocks end and a jmp.l takes us to the next
  block (65816)

- Support "relocation" mode where everything is branches and no jumps



DO LATER

- Write external conversion program for SAN to WDC and WDC to SAN
- Built-in pseudo-instruction / macros for movement: move count source -> destination (65816)
