**THIS IS PRE-ALPHA SOFTWARE. IT DOESN'T WORK (YET). GO AWAY.**

## No, seriously, what's this here now?

I'm writing a powerful assembler for the 6502, 65c02, and 65816 MPUs that does
extensive checks and accepts the Simpler Assembler Notation (SAN). The 65816
will receive special focus, as there are already quite a number of very good
assemblers for the 6502/65c02. 

## Just how far along are you?

As of May 21, 2018 the lexer and parser (the front end) together produce
something that is not completely unlike an Immediate Representation (IR). 

## Pft. Then why is this mess already on GitHub?

Think of it as a backup.

## I have a suggestion ...

Okay, you can stay. Please open an issue with the suggestion. Thanks!

## Features

- Define and check RAM and ROM ranges
- Type checking for instructions
