**THIS IS PRE-ALPHA SOFTWARE. IT DOESN'T WORK YET. GO AWAY.**

## No, seriously, how far along are you?

As of May 19, 2018 the lexer and parser (the front end) together produce
something that is not completely unlike the Immediated Representation (IR). 

## Goals

Create a powerful assembler for the 6502, 65c02, and 65816 MPUs that does
extensive checks.  

## FEATURES

- Type checking for instructions
- Define and check RAM and ROM ranges
- Formatted output


## DEVELOPMENT

This is a hobby program, developed in fits and starts.
