The Cthulhu Assembler only deals with Simpler Assembler Notation (SAN). To
make working with traditional ("WDC") notation easier, this program will
convert the opcodes of one notation to the other. Note that currently
only the opcodes are translated, not the directives, though this might be added
in the future for the Ophis assembler.
